# OAuth2 (HTTP transport)

The HTTP transport of the BoondManager MCP server is an **OAuth2 protected
resource** (per the [MCP Authorization 2025-06-18 spec][mcp-auth] and
[RFC 9728][rfc-9728]). The stdio transport keeps the existing
JWT / BasicAuth env-var methods documented in the [README](../README.md);
this guide covers HTTP only.

```

The MCP server **holds no OAuth state**: no `client_secret`, no refresh
token, no per-user storage. It validates that a Bearer token is present
on every request, pushes it into an `AsyncLocalStorage` context, and
forwards it verbatim to BoondManager when tool calls fire. If
BoondManager rejects the token (401), the failure surfaces back through
the MCP response. Multi-tenant by construction — each user's actions are
attributed to *their* Boond identity in Boond's audit log.

---

## 1. Register an App in BoondManager

OAuth2 is configured per *App* in BoondManager:

1. **Administration → Apps → Security tab.**
2. Toggle **OAuth2** on.
3. Add **at least one redirect URL** — the URL your MCP client uses to
   receive the OAuth callback. For local Claude Desktop / Claude Code,
   that's typically a `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` URL on whichever port
   the client listens on (consult your client's docs). For browser-based
   MCP clients, that's the client's own public callback URL.
4. Note the **Client ID**, **Authorization URL**, and **Access Token URL**
   shown by the Security tab. They are what the MCP client needs in step 3.
5. Configure **Authorized APIs** — these become the scopes the App can
   request.

> The MCP server does **not** need the `client_secret`. That secret lives
> with the MCP client (or in your IdP / OAuth broker, depending on how
> you wire authentication into the MCP client).

---

## 2. Run the MCP server

No bootstrap, no login CLI — just start it.

```bash
export MCP_TRANSPORT=http
export MCP_HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0
export MCP_HTTP_PORT=3000
# Required when behind a reverse proxy so discovery advertises the
# externally-reachable URL.
export MCP_HTTP_PUBLIC_URL=https://mcp.example.com/mcp
npx boondmanager-mcp-server
```

That's it. The server is now:

- accepting OAuth2 Bearer tokens at `https://mcp.example.com/mcp`
- publishing discovery metadata at
  `https://mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`
  (also reachable at the path-suffixed variant
  `…/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp` per RFC 9728 §3.2).

Optional env vars for the discovery metadata:

| Var | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `MCP_HTTP_PUBLIC_URL` | Public URL advertised as the OAuth2 resource identifier. Defaults to `http://<host>:<port><path>` — set this whenever you front the server with a reverse proxy. |
| `BOOND_OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION_SERVER` | Issuer URL of the BoondManager authorization server, advertised in `authorization_servers`. Defaults to `https://ui.boondmanager.com`. |
| `BOOND_OAUTH_SCOPES` | Space/comma-separated list of scope hints advertised in `scopes_supported`. Empty = clients negotiate scopes directly with Boond. |
| `BOOND_BASE_URL` | API base URL used when forwarding tool calls. Defaults to `https://ui.boondmanager.com/api`. |

---

## 3. Configure the MCP client

The MCP client discovers the OAuth flow automatically by fetching the
protected-resource metadata. With a spec-compliant MCP client, the
typical sequence is:

1. Client connects to `https://mcp.example.com/mcp`, gets back `401` +
   `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="…"`.
2. Client fetches the metadata URL, learns the authorization server is
   `https://ui.boondmanager.com`.
3. Client fetches the authorization server's metadata
   (`.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`) — or uses pre-configured
   `authorize` / `token` URLs — and opens the browser for user consent.
4. User authorizes the App in BoondManager. The browser redirects back
   to the client with an `authorization_code`.
5. Client exchanges the code for an `access_token` (and `refresh_token`)
   at the Boond token endpoint, using the App's `client_id` (and
   `client_secret` if non-public).
6. Client retries the MCP request with `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.
7. Server forwards the token to Boond on every API call; refresh happens
   entirely client-side.

If your MCP client does **not** support the discovery flow, configure
the BoondManager OAuth endpoints manually using the values from the App
Security tab.

## 4. Deploying to production

Because the server is stateless, deployment is trivial: just a long-running
HTTP service behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy.

### Docker

```bash
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 \
  -e MCP_HTTP_PUBLIC_URL=https://mcp.example.com/mcp \
  --name boondmanager-mcp \
  ghcr.io/fauguste/boondmanager-mcp-server:latest
```

No volume, no secret, no env var that you wouldn't paste into a Slack
channel. Restart-safe (no state).

### docker-compose

The repo ships a ready-to-use `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
# Optional — only if you need to override MCP_HTTP_PUBLIC_URL etc.
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f mcp
```

### Behind a reverse proxy

Set `MCP_HTTP_PUBLIC_URL` to the public HTTPS URL so the
`resource` field in the discovery metadata and the `realm` /
`resource_metadata` parameters in the 401 challenge advertise the
correct externally-reachable URL.

The reverse proxy must forward at least:
- `Authorization` header (Bearer token)
- `Host` header (or set `MCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` to include the public
  hostname)
- The request body for POSTs

There is nothing to protect at the network layer beyond what the OAuth
token already gates — there is no "service-account" secret stored on the
server that an attacker could steal by reaching the listener.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| `401 Unauthorized` on every MCP request, no `WWW-Authenticate` advertised by the client | MCP client doesn't yet implement the [MCP Authorization spec][mcp-auth]. Configure the BoondManager OAuth endpoints manually. |
| `401 Bearer realm=…` but the client's discovery fails | `MCP_HTTP_PUBLIC_URL` is unset behind a reverse proxy → the metadata advertises `http://0.0.0.0:3000/mcp`, which clients can't reach. Set it to the public HTTPS URL. |
| MCP server logs `BoondManager API 401`, client gets `-32603` | The forwarded access token was rejected by Boond — the user needs to re-authorize. The MCP client should handle this and trigger a new OAuth flow. |
| MCP server logs `No OAuth access token in request context` | Either a stdio code path is being hit on the HTTP transport (bug — file an issue), or `oauthContext.run(...)` was skipped (custom transport modifications). |
| `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` returns 404 | Wrong URL. The endpoint sits at the **root** of the public hostname (not under `/mcp`). |
| `scopes_supported` is missing from the metadata | Expected when `BOOND_OAUTH_SCOPES` is empty — clients then negotiate scopes directly with Boond. |

---

## 6. Implementation notes

- **`src/services/oauth.ts`** — minimal: `oauthContext` (AsyncLocalStorage),
  `extractBearerToken`, `buildProtectedResourceMetadata`,
  `resolveAuthorizationServer`, `resolveAdvertisedScopes`.
- **`src/transports/http.ts`** — extracts the Bearer token before
  dispatching to the SDK's `StreamableHTTPServerTransport`, wraps the
  handler in `oauthContext.run({ accessToken }, …)`, serves the public
  discovery endpoint, returns RFC 6750 §3.1 challenges on missing/invalid
  tokens.
- **`src/services/boond-client.ts`** — `oauthContextAuth` is the
  `BoondAuthProvider` registered by the HTTP bootstrap. It reads the
  context per-call and forwards `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to Boond.
- **No state** is persisted server-side. The container has nothing to
  back up, nothing to rotate, nothing to encrypt at rest.
- Tests: `src/services/oauth.test.ts` (context propagation, header
  parsing, metadata builder), `src/transports/http.test.ts` (401 +
  WWW-Authenticate, discovery endpoint, both metadata variants,
  authorization-server override), `src/services/boond-client.test.ts`
  (concurrent multi-tenant Bearer isolation via `oauthContextAuth`).
